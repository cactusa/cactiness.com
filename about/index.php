                <h1>What this website is all about.</h1>
                <p>In case you are wondering why is such a website online, I will reveal the secret behind it. I am a Postgrduate student from the University of Greenwich. My course required from me to create a unique website for my thesis project. I thought to myself - thesis project plus my genuine love for cacti equals cacti fan-site. This is how cactiness was invented. Of course there was a lot of research around the subject, analysis of competitor website and comparable productions, but that is not very interesting. Just have fun and enjoy my work.

                <img class="figureright" src="/img/elevator.png" width="120" height="186" alt="A picture of a cactus in an elevator." />
                <p>I am a Web Designer in Development and I love cacti as many others do as well. However we do not have a proper source of “cactiness” to rely on. This is why I take it upon myself to create a unique website which would re-introduce the amazing world of cacti to everyone.
                <br/>
                This project would grant me the opportunity to demonstrate my web designer skills in both technical and design aspects.
                <br/>
                The website that I intend to create will be an eye candy full of unique, entertaining and fun content such as jokes, images, videos, short articles. The website’s graphics will create the feeling that cacti are truly idolized. This effect will be achieved by the use of topical to cacti elements throughout the design of each page such as thorns, colour and environment.</p>
                <h2>Additional information:</h2>
