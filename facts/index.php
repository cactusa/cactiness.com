                        Usually when we think of a cactus we picture a desert plant, but there are a few cacti species, which grow in rainforests and even in the cold mountain tops.</li>

                    <li>All cacti are called succulents, because of their moist stems which retain water. However not all succulents are cacti.</li>

                    <li>Cactus plants have spines to protect themselves from animals.</li>

                    <li>The flowers, that some cacti have, grow so as to attract insects to pollinate them.</li>

                    
                    <li>Cacti have long roots situated near the surface to make it easier for them to collect rainwater.</li>

                        The <i>saguaro</i> cactus is the largest growing species of cacti. It has been known to grow up to 20 m tall and 1 m thick. Saguaros have a relatively long life span. They take up to 75 years to develop a side arm. The arms themselves are grown to increase the plant's reproductive capacity (more apices equal more flowers and fruit).

                    <li>In a hot, dry desert area cactus juice can be used to keep hydrated. The liquid isn’t pure water, but it’s absolutely drinkable.</li>
